               <p>
                  Raised in a Spanish-English bilingual household, my tongue was the sharpest tool 🔧 I had and I wanted
                  to refine it even more by understanding language as a science. After studying linguistics and everything
                  in between, I was a special education teacher assistant and found significant value in shadowing 
                  speech-language pathologists. Drawing upon their techniques enhanced my experience as a language teacher 
                  👩🏻‍🏫 and knowledge of language nuances. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  In <i>Barcelona</i> *spanish accent* 🍷💃🏻, I took my linguistics studies further in a master's program
                  as well as took on positions regarding natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Once 
                  I heard the term <i>conversation design</i>, I perked up and wanted in. Along that journey, I picked up 
                  foundational concepts of web development which made this very pretty site. Btw, how'd I do? 😋 
               </p>
               <p>
                  TL;DR I'm an educator, linguist, conversation designer, and web developer 🤹🏻‍♀️🦸‍♀️

                  From the perspective of a special educator and linguist, a simple "hello" 👋🏼 
                  can be a struggle but is also the jumpstart to a meaningful connection. 
                  Given my background, I've grown eager to transform data 💾 in all its forms 
                  into something with personality for connections and experiences with purpose.

                  Oh my goodness, you would not believe the number of gigs I've had
                  over years, sometimes at the same time. My immigrant father passed
                  down his work ethic to me; needless to say, I have the the work ethic
                  of a middle-aged working class Mexican man.

                  In my off time, I take on home renovation projects in my family's 
                  200-year-old colonial 🏡 in New Jersey. There's something about 
                  working with my hands that makes me kiss my own biceps! 
                  Other than that, I do my best to practice minimalism and <i>experience</i>
